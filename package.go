// Package go_google provides utilties for using the Google API.
//
// These are not really production quality packages, nor are they maintained or supported, they're
// simplistic mechanisms implemented to solve specific problems in code that the author has been writing for his own use.
// They are provided as examples and because using private repositories with Google modules is currently a tad tricky.
//
// If you need this functionality consider copying the code into your own project and modifying to fit your need.
