# Google API utilities

Go packages for accessing google APIs.

These are not really production quality packages, nor are they maintained or supported.
They're simplistic mechanisms implemented to solve specific problems
in code that the author has been writing for his own use.
They are provided as examples and because
using private repositories with Google modules is currently a tad tricky.

*If you need this functionality consider copying the code into your own project and modifying to fit your need.*

See the source for documentation.

## `oauth2`

Generate and use OAuth2 tokens for API access.

This requires a project to be configured via the Google developer console,
which kind of requires the user to have their own domain.

## `sheets`

Simplify some nteractions with Google Sheets.
