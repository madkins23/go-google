* test with a real application
* more unit tests?
  just did simple ones, the rest will require much more work
* code verifier with SHA1 hash
  tried this and failed, not sure what was problem
* can we detect changes in access assigned to token and re-get token?
  doesn't look like it, the access token doesn't have the scopes with which it was authenticated
